How to use
==========

1. Run `getdata` once every day. It creates and updates an SQLite database called `channels.db`.
2. Run `server` to serve the website with the current `channels.db`.

If you intend to run your own version or even a fork, [download the current data](https://ln.bigsun.xyz/static/channels.db) instead of starting from scratch. It will be good to have another person taking care of this.
